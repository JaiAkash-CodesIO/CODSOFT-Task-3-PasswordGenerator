Password Generator (Python GUI)
Welcome to my Password Generator project! This is a simple but powerful application built using Python's Tkinter library, designed to generate strong, random passwords. You can specify the length of the password, and the app will instantly generate a secure password for you.

This tool can be super handy if you're looking for strong passwords to use for various websites, applications, or anywhere you need robust protection.
Features
Custom Length: Specify how long you want your password to be.
Randomized Passwords: Combines uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.
Copy to Clipboard: After generating the password, you can easily copy it to your clipboard with just one click.
How It Works
You enter the desired length of the password (e.g., 8, 12, 16 characters).
Click the "Generate Password" button, and the app will create a secure password for you.
You can click "Copy to Clipboard" to copy the generated password for use elsewhere.
Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed.
